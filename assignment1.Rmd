## My Goals for hudk4050 {.css_class}
 - Learn how to use R.
 - Learn how to learn with self-discipline.
 - Learn from my peers and build a collabrative learning environment.

## Video Review {.css_class}
I think online learning can be a double-edged sword. I am a slow-learner, so it's a bonus that I can stop the video anytime and take some time to figure things out. But learning by myself can be intimidating and ineffective when I don't have a interactive learning space.
